# Event_Listener_Pairing_DOM

# Overview
In this activity, you will be writing HTML, CSS, and JS to fulfill the requirements of progressively more difficult prompts. Try to get as far as you can through the prompts. 

# Getting Started
1. The Driver should create a repository and add the Navigator as a collaborator.
2. Clone the repository. Both partners should have local copies.
3. Swap the Driver/Navigator roles after each exercise.
4. Use Git and Github to collaborate. Remember to pull and push.

# Instructions For each exercise:

- Create a new folder within your repository.
- In that folder, create index.html, index.js , and style.css.
- Write HTML to have all the required elements.
- Write CSS to style the elements.
- Write JS so that the elements are interactive.
- Double-check your code.
- These prompts leave many details up to your discretion. You are encouraged to add flavor text, different fonts, and cool styles. Add your own flair to your websites.

# Tips
If you are feeling stuck, try asking yourself the following questions:

1. Are all the required HTML elements on the page?
2. Are the DOM selectors selecting the correct elements?
3. Are event listeners added to the specified elements?
4. Are the event listeners listening for the correct event?
5. Does the callback function modify the correct elements?

# ** There are five tabs (one for each exercise) to help you stay organized as you work. Your goal is to complete exercises 1, 2, and 3. If you finish early, see if you can complete one or both of the extension exercises.
