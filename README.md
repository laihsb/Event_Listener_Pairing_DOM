# Event_Listener_Pairing_DOM

# Overview
In this activity, you will be writing HTML, CSS, and JS to fulfill the requirements of progressively more difficult prompts. Try to get as far as you can through the prompts. 

# Getting Started
1. The Driver should create a repository and add the Navigator as a collaborator.
2. Clone the repository. Both partners should have local copies.
3. Swap the Driver/Navigator roles after each exercise.
4. Use Git and Github to collaborate. Remember to pull and push.

# Instructions For each exercise:

- Create a new folder within your repository.
- In that folder, create index.html, index.js , and style.css.
- Write HTML to have all the required elements.
- Write CSS to style the elements.
- Write JS so that the elements are interactive.
- Double-check your code.
- These prompts leave many details up to your discretion. You are encouraged to add flavor text, different fonts, and cool styles. Add your own flair to your websites.

# Tips
If you are feeling stuck, try asking yourself the following questions:

1. Are all the required HTML elements on the page?
2. Are the DOM selectors selecting the correct elements?
3. Are event listeners added to the specified elements?
4. Are the event listeners listening for the correct event?
5. Does the callback function modify the correct elements?

# ** There are five tabs (one for each exercise) to help you stay organized as you work. Your goal is to complete exercises 1, 2, and 3. If you finish early, see if you can complete one or both of the extension exercises.

# Cookie clicker
Your website should have two main components: 
1. an image of a cookie 
2. and a counter that starts at 0. Whenever the cookie is clicked, the counter should go up by one.

# Magnifying Glass
Your website should have:
- a paragraph of placeholder text - along with two buttons.
    - One button should make the text bigger when clicked.
    - The other button should make the text smaller when clicked 
    
- The font size should not get smaller than 1px and should not get larger than 100px.

# Green Screen
- Your website should have a text input box with a corresponding button. 
- When the button is clicked, the background color of the entire website should change to match what the user typed into the box. - If the user did not input a valid color name, then nothing should happen.

- Note: Your website should support at least five valid colors.

# Crane Game
- Your website should show an image of a crane alongside four buttons. 
- Each button corresponds to a cardinal direction (up, down, left, right), and will move the crane in that direction when clicked.

# Dice
Your website should have a text input box labeled "Number of sides" and a button labeled "Roll". When the button is clicked, a random number will appear between 1 and the number that the user input. For example, if the user types 6 into the box and clicks the button, then a number between 1 to 6 will appear. A different random number should be generated every time that button is clicked.
